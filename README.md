Drone Trajectory Tracking for Train Diagnostics
This work aims to address the issue of trajectory tracking of a drone that needs to rejoin the diagnostic train after performing a measurement. The train's trajectory is assumed to follow a curvilinear path that approximates the movement of a real train, and the goal is to make the drone land on it while the train is still in movement. The leader-following consensus algorithm and the LQR have been exploited and are going to be furtherly discussed. By analyzing different case scenarios, the best control strategies will be worked out for a vertical and an oblique landing.
